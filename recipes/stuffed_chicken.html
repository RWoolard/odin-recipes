        <ol>
            <li>Make the fajita seasoning: To a small bowl, mix all the fajita seasoning ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Next, make the fajita veggie mixture: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic 
                together with the onion and saute for 2-3 minutes. Add the peppers, then sprinkle with ½ of the fajita mix and 
                cook for 3 minutes more. Set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Prepare and stuff the chicken: Cut a lengthways pocket to each chicken breast. Rub the chicken with the remaining 
                fajita seasoning all over, then stuff the pocket with a spoonful of fajita-pepper mixture and cheddar cheese. Seal 
                with a toothpick by inserting it diagonally, to keep the stuffing in.</li><br>
            <li>Cook the stuffed chicken: To the same skillet, add the remaining oil and sear the chicken breast for 4-5 minutes 
                per side. Next, add ¼ cup of water to the pan, cover, and cook over low heat for 6-8 minutes, or until the chicken 
                is fully cooked through.</li><br>
